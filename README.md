# Rezi Bot
The bot is now archived due to low interest and the emergence of the [Rezi website](https://rezi.one). Also due to Discord's ToS and its (forced or not) view on piracy, making it a bad platform for hosting piracy related content. The website is free forever and always available, so go give it a try. The code is all here for the bot, so you can learn from it, reboot the project, or use it as a base for a new bot (although I wouldn't recommend it due to the lack of slash commands and using the old Discord API).
